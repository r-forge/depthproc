\section{DepthCurve and DepthCurveList}{


DepthCurve is a virtual class that contains methods (getPlot(...) and plot(...)) for rendering single curve such as ScaleCurve or AsymmetryCurve. Such object can be added by overloaded operator '%+%'. This 'addition' create DepthCurveList that can be used for rendering plot with multiple curves. Sample session (using ScaleCurve) is shown in Examples section.
